This is one good health app

This repository, as of now contains the android application code. In this app we are taking three parameters from user his weight(in kg),
height(in inches) and age. By this we want to suggest some diet plan to user by our python script if someday user wants to eat something 
that is unhealty than we are having label detector which will detect food item and then it will show calories, another good thing in this
is heart rate checker
